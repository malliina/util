An exploration of Scala. Test code for wicket, play!, web sockets, actors, functional programming, and whatever seems interesting.

To do:

- Evaluate Slick after 2.10 is released
- User authentication based on certificate
- MSI packaging
- Play 2.x AsyncResult & Futures
- More HA apps with DRBD
- IPsec DRBD
- A sane container class for sbt-native-packager mappings that spits out settings for rpm, deb, windows
