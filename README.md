An exploration of Scala. Test code for wicket, play!, web sockets, actors, functional programming, and whatever seems interesting.

To do:
- Push wicket to heroku
- LDAP server authorization editor + update to UserManager trait.
- Play fucks up the logback configuration jesus christ
- Evaluate whether it makes sense to have DB operations that return Promise[ResultSet]
- Evaluate Slick after 2.10 is released
