An exploration of Scala. Test code for wicket, play!, web sockets, actors, functional programming, and whatever seems interesting.

To do:

- Evaluate Slick after 2.10 is released
- User authentication based on certificate
- Test LDAP server with some 3PP, e.g. subsonic, and user management using my modules
- MSI packaging
- Play fucks up the logback configuration jesus christ
- More HA apps with DRBD
- A sane container class for sbt-native-packager mappings that spits out settings for rpm, deb, windows
- DB operations that return Promise[ResultSet]
